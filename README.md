This project implements a fast marine route optimization system using A* pathfinding, real-time weather data, and India’s coastal map.
It is built using Flask, Folium, NetworkX, and Ngrok to expose the app publicly.

The system allows users to select start and destination ports, calculates the optimal sea route, and displays it on an interactive map along with weather data (wind & wave height) along the path.
